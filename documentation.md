### async_main.py

##### Description:
- You define an asynchronous function called main, which serves as the main coroutine for your asynchronous code.
- You attempt to get the current running event loop using asyncio.get_running_loop(). If there is no running event loop, a RuntimeError is caught and handled by setting loop to None.
- If an event loop is already running (loop is not None and loop.is_running() returns True), you create a task from the main coroutine using loop.create_task(main()). This task represents the execution of the main coroutine on the event loop.
- You add a callback to the task using tsk.add_done_callback(). This callback function will print the result of the task when the coroutine completes.
- If there is no running event loop, you start a new one by using asyncio.run(main()), which runs the main coroutine and creates a new event loop for it.

##### Returns:
```
Async event loop already running. Adding coroutine to the event loop.
Async main
Task done with result=None  << return val of main()
```

### network_request_example.py

##### Description:
- We import the necessary modules: asyncio for asynchronous programming and aiohttp for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- We define a list of URLs (urls) from which we want to fetch data concurrently.
- The fetch_url function is an asynchronous function that uses aiohttp to make a GET request to a URL and returns the response text if the request is successful (HTTP status code 200).
- The main function is the entry point of our program. It creates a list of tasks, each corresponding to a URL, and uses asyncio.gather to wait for all tasks to complete concurrently.

##### Returns:
```

### parallel_processing.py

##### Description:
- We import the necessary modules: asyncio for asynchronous programming and concurrent.futures for parallel processing of CPU-bound tasks.
- We define a list of tasks (tasks) that represents CPU-bound tasks we want to execute in parallel. In this example, we simply square each number in the list.
- The cpu_bound_task function simulates a CPU-bound task. You can replace this with your actual CPU-bound task code.
- The process_tasks function uses a concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor to run CPU-bound tasks in parallel. It creates an event loop, schedules the tasks using loop.run_in_executor, and gathers the results.
- In the main function, we run the process_tasks function asynchronously and print the results.

##### Returns:
```
Task 1: Result = 1
Task 2: Result = 4
Task 3: Result = 9
Task 4: Result = 16
Task 5: Result = 25
Task done with result=None  << return val of main()
```

### asyncio_best_practices.py

##### Description:
- We import the asyncio module for asynchronous programming.
- The perform_io_operation function is a simple asynchronous function that simulates I/O operations. It uses await asyncio.sleep(1) to simulate a 1-second I/O delay and then prints a completion message.
- The main function is the entry point of our program. It creates a list of tasks for concurrent execution using asyncio.create_task and appends them to the tasks list.
- We use asyncio.gather(*tasks) to wait for all tasks to complete concurrently. This ensures that the I/O operations run in parallel.

##### Returns:
```
Reloaded modules: defs
IO operation 1 completed
IO operation 3 completed
IO operation 5 completed
IO operation 2 completed
IO operation 4 completed
Task done with result=None  << return val of main()
```

### folder file_io/

##### Content:
- sync_file_io.py
- async_file_io.py

##### Description:
- sync_file_io.py is a Python script that demonstrates synchronous (blocking) file I/O operations. It simulates fetching a file, where each file fetch operation takes one second to complete.
- async_file_io.py is a Python script that demonstrates asynchronous (non-blocking) file I/O operations using the asyncio library. It simulates fetching a file, with each file fetch operation taking one second to complete.

##### Returns:
- sync_file_io.py
```
Starting to fetch file
Fetching file completed
Starting to fetch file
Fetching file completed
Starting to fetch file
Fetching file completed
Main completed
```
- async_file_io.py

### Folder subroutine_vs_coroutine/

##### Content:
- classic_subroutine_approach.py
- coroutine_approach.py

##### Description:
- In this classic subroutine approach, we define a function sum_numbers_classic that takes a list of numbers and iterates through them to calculate the sum.
- In this coroutine approach, we define an asynchronous function sum_numbers_coroutine. Inside this function, we calculate the sum of numbers, but we also include await asyncio.sleep(0) to yield control to the event loop briefly. This allows other tasks to run concurrently if they exist.

    The main function is an asynchronous entry point that runs the coroutine and prints the result.

    When you run the coroutine approach, you'll see that it can handle asynchronous operations while calculating the sum, making it suitable for scenarios where you want to avoid blocking the event loop.

##### Returns:
- classic_subroutine_approach.py
```
Sum of numbers (classic): 15
```
- coroutine_approach.py
```
Sum of numbers (coroutine): 15
```
