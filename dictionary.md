1. **Coroutines**: Coroutines are the building blocks of asyncio.
   They are functions that can be paused and resumed later, allowing you to write non-blocking code that can switch between tasks quickly.

2. **Event loops**: The event loop is the core of asyncio.
   It schedules and runs coroutines, and manages I/O operations.
   You should only create one event loop per thread, and it should be started with the run_until_complete() method.

3. **Tasks**: Tasks are a higher-level abstraction than coroutines.
   They represent a coroutine that is running in the background, and allow you to cancel, pause, and resume the coroutine.
   You can use the asyncio.create_task() function to create a new task.

4. **Timeout**: The asyncio module provides a way to set a timeout for an operation using the asyncio.wait_for() function.
   This can be useful when you want to limit the amount of time a coroutine can spend waiting for a result.

5. **Futures**: Task is a subclass of Future.
   Futures are objects that represent a result that may not be available yet.
   You can use the asyncio.Future class to create a new future, and the await keyword to wait for the result.

6. **Queue**: A Queue is a data structure that allows multiple coroutines to communicate with each other.
   It can be used to pass messages between coroutines or to coordinate the execution of multiple coroutines.

7. **Patterns**:
   - The **"Fire-and-Forget" design pattern** allows you to execute a task asynchronously without waiting for its result.
     This means that you can start the task and immediately continue with other work, without blocking or waiting for the task to complete.

     Fire-and-Forget is useful when you have a task that needs to be executed in the background, but the result of that task isn’t needed immediately.
     For example, **sending an email** or **logging a message** are both tasks that don’t require an immediate response, and can be executed asynchronously using the Fire-and-Forget pattern.

   - The **Pub/Sub design pattern**, short for Publish/Subscribe, is a messaging pattern used in distributed systems and event-driven architectures. 
     In the Pub/Sub pattern, there are three key components:
     - Publisher: This component, also known as the producer, is responsible for generating and sending messages or events to a central message broker or topic.
       Publishers are decoupled from subscribers, meaning they don't need to know who or what will receive their messages.
     - Subscriber: Subscribers, or consumers, are components or services that express interest in specific types of messages or events.
       They subscribe to one or more topics or channels and receive messages when they are published to those topics.
       Subscribers are decoupled from publishers, allowing for flexibility in handling messages.
     - Message Broker or Topic: The message broker or topic acts as an intermediary that receives messages from publishers and delivers them to subscribers based on their interests.
       It maintains a registry of subscribers and ensures that messages are sent to the appropriate recipients.

     Example Use Cases:
     - **Notifications**: Sending notifications to multiple users or systems when a specific event occurs.
     - **Real-time Data Processing**: Processing real-time data streams, such as social media updates or sensor data.
     - **Monitoring and Logging**: Collecting and distributing log messages or monitoring events across a distributed system.
       
   - The **Data pipelines design pattern** is a methodology for processing and transforming data as it flows from one stage to another in a structured and automated way.
     Data pipelines are used to move, clean, enrich, or otherwise process data from various sources to a destination, often a database, data warehouse, or analytical system.

     Key components and concepts of data pipelines:
     - Source: The source of data, which can be databases, logs, APIs, or any other data repositories.
     - Processing Stages: These are the intermediate stages where data is transformed, cleaned, or enriched.
       Each stage may perform specific operations on the data.
     - Destination: The final endpoint where processed data is stored or consumed.
       This can be a database, data warehouse, or any other system that requires the data.
     - Automation: Data pipelines are typically automated and scheduled to run at regular intervals or in response to specific events.

     Example Use Cases:
     - **E-commerce**: Processing and analyzing customer orders, payments, and product data.
     - **Log Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing log data from web servers or applications.
     - **IoT Data**: Handling and processing data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices in real time.
     - **Data Warehousing**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data into a data warehouse for business intelligence and reporting.
